I Don't Need No Stinking API: Web Scraping For Fun and Profit

How My Finished, Final Code Works
TL;DR: Here’s a link to my code on github.
It has a readme for getting you setup and
started on your own amazon.com crawler.

HTML parsing
Most of the code I write is in Python, and I love BeautifulSoup
for its error handling and super-simple API. I also love its motto:
  You didn’t write that awful page.  You’re just trying to get some
  data out of it. Beautiful Soup is here to help. :)
Using the built-in Unix screen command allows you to disconnect
from your crawling process without worrying that it’ll go away.
You can close your laptop and simple SSH back in later, reconnect
to the screen, and you’ll see your crawling process still humming
along.
