Who should use this service: 
Many customers pay foreign transaction fees when they use their credit cards for cross
border transactions.  We've worked hard to provide competitive rates, but you should
compare our rates with your credit card statements to determine if using our currency
conversion service is right for you.

Things you should know: 
o Marketplace and DevPay invoices are not currently eligible for this service and will
  be processed in USD

  Console.
