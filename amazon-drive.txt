When accessing amazon drive online got popup:

Unlimited Storage   $59.99 per year
Your unlimited plan, ending on 1/21/18,
is no longer offered.  After that, your account will be
automatically renewed into the 1 TB plan for your existing
rate of $59.99 per year.

This is separate from gmail's 4GB of 15GB used.
Do not think google drive at $59.99 for 1TB per year is worth it.

Are you sure?
-------------
At the end of your plan, if you stored content is greater than your
storage quota:
o You won't be able to upload new files.  Prime members can continue
  to upload photo files.
o You can access and download your content for 180 days.
o After 180 days, your content will be deleted according to our Data
  Retention Policy. Learn more

click Do not renew

Unlimited Storage
$59.99 per year
Your unlimited plan, ending on 1/21/18, is no longer offered.
After that, you’ll need to choose one of the new data storage
plans to continue using the service.

Unlimited Storage disabled - looks good.
